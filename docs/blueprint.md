- Complementary Dish Suggestion: Suggest three complementary dishes or sides, along with ingredients and preparation steps, for a user-specified main course ('¿Con qué puedo acompañar?'). This uses a tool, where the tool decides when the main course should change or influence the sides suggested
- Recipe Display: Display chosen recipes with an image, list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
- Recipe Management: Allow users to save recipes to their favorites list (locally in browser storage), remove them from the list, and share recipes via a shareable link.
